        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Evan Grau. If you're here, that means you wanted a more detailed explanation of who I am. Let's get started.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born in <a href="https://blufftonindiana.net">Bluffton, Indiana</a> on September 22, 2002. I lived there until I was about 13 years old, when
            my family and I moved to <a href="https://www.chandleraz.gov">Chandler, Arizona</a> because my dad got a job at Arizona State University. I lived
            there until I was about 16 years old when we moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. My family has lived there since we moved in 2019. The last half of my junior
            year of high school was when COVID first hit the US and affected how public schools were functioning. My entire senior year of high school was affected by COVID
            in some fashion, but that didn't stop me from becoming Valedictorian of my class. After graduating from high school, I started applying to colleges, but
            ACU was the one that really caught my eye. I took a tour of the campus and that's what sold me on attending ACU.
